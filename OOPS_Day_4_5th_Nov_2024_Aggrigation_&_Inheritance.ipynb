    "##### Department aggregates Employee objects by storing them (using methods like add_employee()).\n",
    "##### The Employee class represents individual employees, and the Employee objects can exist without being inside a Department.\n",

    "##### add_employee(): This method in the Department class connects or adds Employee objects to the department.\n",
    "##### Independence: Employee objects are independent of the Department, meaning if the Department is removed, the Employee objects still exist.\n",

    "Here's a clear breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`self.employees` contains objects of the `Employee` class**:\n",
    "   - When you add `e1`, `e2`, and `e3` to the `employees` list in the `Department` class, you're adding instances (objects) of the `Employee` class.\n",
    "   - So, when you print `self.employees`, it will display something like:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     [<__main__.Employee object at 0x7f9b8c123d30>, <__main__.Employee object at 0x7f9b8c123d60>, ...]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This is a list of **objects** of the `Employee` class, each with a memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`get_info()` is a method of the `Employee` class**:\n",
    "   - The `get_info()` method is defined inside the `Employee` class. Therefore, it can only be called on objects of the `Employee` class.\n",
    "   - So, when you call `emp.get_info()` inside the `show_employees()` method, you are calling the `get_info()` method on each `Employee` object in `self.employees`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accessing `get_info()` via `e1`, `e2`, `e3`**:\n",
    "   - As you correctly pointed out, the `self.employees` list holds the `Employee` objects (`e1`, `e2`, `e3`, etc.).\n",
    "   - During the iteration in `show_employees()`, the loop variable `emp` refers to each of these `Employee` objects one by one. When you call `emp.get_info()`, it calls the `get_info()` method on the current `Employee` object (`e1`, `e2`, or `e3` in each iteration), which prints the employee's name and position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap:\n",
    "- **The `self.employees` list contains objects of the `Employee` class** (like `e1`, `e2`, `e3`).\n",
    "- **The `get_info()` method is accessed via the `Employee` class objects**, i.e., `e1`, `e2`, `e3`, etc., during the iteration in `show_employees()`.\n",
    "- **Each call to `emp.get_info()` prints data specific to the current object**, because the method uses the instance (`self`) to access the `name` and `position` attributes of that particular object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you are correct! **You are accessing the `get_info()` method through the objects of the `Employee` class (`e1`, `e2`, `e3`, etc.)** and it prints the data inside those objects.\n",

    "### Breakdown of Your Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parent Class (`phone`)**:\n",
    "   - The `phone` class has an `__init__` constructor that takes **3 parameters**: `price`, `brand`, and `camera`.\n",
    "   - This constructor is responsible for initializing the attributes (`self.price`, `self.brand`, `self.camera`) of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Child Class (`smartphone`)**:\n",
    "   - The `smartphone` class **inherits** from `phone`, which means that it **inherits all the methods and properties** of the `phone` class (including the `__init__` method).\n",
    "   - However, since the `smartphone` class **doesn't define its own `__init__` constructor**, it **inherits the constructor** from `phone`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constructor Execution During Object Creation**:\n",
    "   - When you create an object of the `smartphone` class (e.g., `s = smartphone()`), **Python first tries to call the constructor** (`__init__` method) of the `smartphone` class.\n",
    "   - Since `smartphone` doesn't have its own `__init__` constructor, Python looks for the constructor in the parent class (`phone`).\n",
    "   - The `phone` class constructor requires **3 parameters**: `price`, `brand`, and `camera`. If you don't provide these parameters when creating the object, Python raises a `TypeError` because it's trying to call `phone.__init__()` without the required arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Need to Pass Parameters**:\n",
    "   - The reason you need to pass arguments (like `price=999`, `brand=\"Apple\"`, and `camera=\"12MP\"`) when you create an object of `smartphone` is because **those arguments are required by the constructor of `phone`** (the parent class).\n",
    "   - Since `smartphone` inherits `phone`'s constructor and doesn't have its own, the arguments are passed up to the `phone` class constructor during object creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Default Constructor**:\n",
    "   - If you don't define an `__init__` constructor in a class, Python will provide a **default constructor** that doesn't take any arguments except `self`. This is why if you don't explicitly define `__init__`, a default constructor is used.\n",
    "   - In your case, since the `smartphone` class doesn't define `__init__`, Python uses the constructor from `phone`, which has its own required parameters. That's why you need to provide the arguments when creating a `smartphone` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, Yes, You Are Correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `smartphone` class **inherits the constructor** of the `phone` class, because it doesn't define its own `__init__`.\n",
    "- When you create an instance of the `smartphone` class, **the `phone.__init__()` constructor is automatically executed** and it needs the parameters `price`, `brand`, and `camera` to initialize the object.\n",
    "- The **constructor is executed automatically** when you create an object, but it fails if the required arguments are not passed, leading to the error.\n",
    "- If you don't explicitly define an `__init__` method in a class, Python will **use a default constructor** (without any parameters) for that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Child class inherits from parent**: `smartphone` inherits the `phone` class, including its methods and properties.\n",
    "- **Constructor execution**: The constructor (`__init__`) of the parent class is automatically executed when you create an instance of `smartphone`. But since `phone.__init__` expects parameters, you need to pass them when creating the object of `smartphone`.\n",
    "- **Default constructor**: If you don't define a constructor in a class, Python provides a default one. However, if the parent class has a constructor that requires arguments, the child class must handle passing those arguments (either by defining its own constructor or passing them during object creation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Your understanding is spot on! You correctly understood that the **constructor of the parent class** is called automatically when you create an object of the child class, and since it requires parameters, you must provide them at object creation time. You also understood the concept of **default constructors** in Python."
