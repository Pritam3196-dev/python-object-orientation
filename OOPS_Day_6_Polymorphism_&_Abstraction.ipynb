    "\n",
    "### Simple Breakdown of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Class Definition (`operator_overloading`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class operator_overloading:\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **What is a class?**  \n",
    "A class is like a blueprint for creating objects (things). In this case, the class `operator_overloading` is a blueprint for creating objects that hold a `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **The `__init__` Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "    self.value = value  # 'value' is set when the object is created.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is `__init__`?**  \n",
    "This is called the **constructor**. When you create a new object from the class, Python automatically calls this method. The constructor is used to initialize (or set) the values of the object's properties (in this case, `value`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`self.value`**:  \n",
    "This means the value that belongs to each individual object. Each object will have its own `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "When we create `a = operator_overloading(10)`, this method runs and sets `a.value` to `10`. Similarly, for `b = operator_overloading(20)`, `b.value` is set to `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **The `__add__` Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is `__add__`?**  \n",
    "This is a **special method** that gets called when you use the `+` operator between two objects. So, when you do `a + b`, Python looks for `__add__` to define what should happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What does `self` and `other` mean?**  \n",
    "- `self`: Refers to the first object (`a` in this case).  \n",
    "- `other`: Refers to the second object (`b` in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **The Logic Inside `__add__`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at what happens inside the `__add__` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 1: When `other` is another object of the same class (`operator_overloading`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(other, operator_overloading):\n",
    "    return self.value + other.value  # Add the 'value' of both objects.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is `isinstance(other, operator_overloading)`?**  \n",
    "This checks if the `other` object is an instance of the `operator_overloading` class. In other words, we are checking if the second operand (`b`) is also an object created from the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What happens if `other` is an object?**  \n",
    "If `other` is also an `operator_overloading` object, we **add their `value` attributes together** (i.e., `self.value + other.value`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**  \n",
    "For `a = operator_overloading(10)` and `b = operator_overloading(20)`, this line will return `10 + 20 = 30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 2: When `other` is a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elif isinstance(other, str):\n",
    "    return self.value + other  # Concatenate the string with 'self.value'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is `isinstance(other, str)`?**  \n",
    "This checks if `other` is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What happens if `other` is a string?**  \n",
    "If the second operand is a string, we **concatenate** the `value` of the first object with the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**  \n",
    "If `a = operator_overloading(\"Hello\")` and `b = \" World\"`, this line would return `\"Hello\" + \" World\"`, which gives `\"Hello World\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 3: When `other` is a number (integer or float):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elif isinstance(other, (int, float)):\n",
    "    return self.value + other  # Add the number to 'self.value'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is `isinstance(other, (int, float))`?**  \n",
    "This checks if `other` is either an integer (`int`) or a floating-point number (`float`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What happens if `other` is a number?**  \n",
    "If the second operand is a number, we simply **add it to `self.value`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**  \n",
    "If `a = operator_overloading(10)` and `b = 5`, this line would return `10 + 5 = 15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Case 4: If none of the above cases are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return NotImplemented  # Return this if the operation isn't supported.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is `NotImplemented`?**  \n",
    "If `other` is none of the above (not an object, string, or number), we return `NotImplemented`. This tells Python that we don't know how to handle this operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Creating Objects and Using the `+` Operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = operator_overloading(10)  # Object 'a' with value 10\n",
    "b = operator_overloading(20)  # Object 'b' with value 20\n",
    "result = a + b  # This calls the __add__ method for 'a' and 'b'\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 30 (because 10 + 20 = 30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating objects**:  \n",
    "  `a = operator_overloading(10)` creates an object `a` with a value of `10`, and `b = operator_overloading(20)` creates an object `b` with a value of `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using the `+` operator**:  \n",
    "  `result = a + b` calls the `__add__` method. Inside `__add__`, Python checks if both `a` and `b` are objects of the `operator_overloading` class. Since they are, it adds their `value` attributes (i.e., `10 + 20`) and returns `30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of What Happens in Simple Words:\n",
    "1. **You create two objects (`a` and `b`)** of the `operator_overloading` class, each holding a `value` (10 and 20).\n",
    "2. **When you use `a + b`**, Python automatically calls the `__add__` method of `a` to perform the addition.\n",
    "3. Inside `__add__`, Python checks if `b` is an instance of `operator_overloading` and adds the `value` of `a` (10) to the `value` of `b` (20).\n",
    "4. The result (`30`) is returned and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how operator overloading works in simple terms. You are defining **how to use the `+` operator** with objects of your custom class."
